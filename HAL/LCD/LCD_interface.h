/** @brief 	This function is responsible for initializing an LCD display module.
 *			The function first checks if the LCD mode is set to 8-bit or 4-bit mode using preprocessor directives. Depending on the mode, 
 *          it initializes the necessary pins for the LCD display module using the GPIO_Init() function. 
 *          If the data pins and control pins are on separate ports, it initializes both ports.
 * 			The function then sets the direction of the necessary pins to output using the GPIO_SetPinDirection() function. 
 *          The necessary pins include data pins D0-D7, RS (Register Select) pin, and EN (Enable) pin.
 *			The function then waits for 1 millisecond using the STK_Delay() function (will be implemented) to give the LCD display module time to power up.
 *			Next, the function sends commands to the LCD display module using the LCD_SendCommand() function. 
 *          The commands include setting the LCD mode to 8-bit or 4-bit mode, clearing the display, and turning on the display.
 *			If the LCD mode is not set to 8-bit or 4-bit mode, the function throws an error using a preprocessor directive.

/** @brief	This function is responsible for sending a command to the LCD display module.
 *			The function first sets the RS (Register Select) pin to low to indicate that a command is being sent.
 *           It also sets the RW (Read/Write) pin to low to indicate that the operation is a write operation.
 *			Depending on the LCD mode (8-bit or 4-bit), the function sets the necessary data pins.
 *			The function then sets the EN (Enable) pin to high to enable the LCD display module to read the command. 
 *          After a short delay using the STK_Delay(), the function sets the EN pin to low to complete the command.
 * 
 *          Difference between the 2 modes:
 *			If the LCD mode is set to 4-bit mode, the function shifts the 4 least significant bits of the command to the 4 most significant bits and repeats the same process for these bits.
 *          If the LCD mode is set to 8-bit mode, data is represented normally.
 *			If the LCD mode is not set to 8-bit or 4-bit mode, the function throws an error using a preprocessor directive.

/** @brief	This function is responsible for sending a character to the LCD display module.
 *			The function first sets the RS (Register Select) pin to high to indicate that a data character is being sent. It also sets the RW (Read/Write) pin to low to indicate that the operation is a write operation.
 *			Depending on the LCD mode (8-bit or 4-bit), the function sets the necessary data pins to the corresponding bits of the character using the GPIO_SetPinValue() function.
 *			The function then sets the EN (Enable) pin to high to enable the LCD display module to read the character. After a short delay (about 1 or 2 ms) using the STK_Delay() function, the function sets the EN pin to low to complete the character transmission.
 *			If the LCD mode is set to 4-bit mode, the function shifts the 4 least significant bits of the character to the 4 most significant bits and repeats the same process for these bits.
 *			If the LCD mode is not set to 8-bit or 4-bit mode, the function throws an error using a preprocessor directive.
 * 
 *          Difference between the 2 modes (GPT):
 *			The main difference between 8-bit and 4-bit modes in LCD interfacing lies in how many data lines are used to send commands and data to the LCD.
 *
 *           1. **8-bit Mode:**
 *              - In 8-bit mode, 8 data lines (D0-D7) are used to transmit both commands and data to the LCD.
 *              - This mode allows faster data transfer since all 8 bits of data are sent in parallel.
 *              - Typically, 8-bit mode requires more GPIO pins on the microcontroller for data transmission.
 *           
 *           2. **4-bit Mode:**
 *              - In 4-bit mode, only 4 data lines (D4-D7) are used to transmit commands and data to the LCD. The other 4 data lines (D0-D3) are not used.
 *              - The 4-bit mode is slower compared to 8-bit mode because data is sent in two 4-bit nibbles sequentially.
 *              - 4-bit mode saves GPIO pins on the microcontroller, making it more suitable for projects with limited GPIO resources.
 *              - Despite being slower, the difference in speed may not be noticeable in many applications.
 *           
 *           Both modes have their advantages and disadvantages, but 4-bit mode is often preferred in projects where GPIO pin count is a concern, and the slight decrease in speed is acceptable. Additionally, 4-bit mode is sufficient for many applications and significantly reduces the number of connections required between the microcontroller and the LCD.

 *  @param Character  : character to be displayed.
